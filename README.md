# Dan-ial

Our friend Dan left PennApps after an hour, so we started this social project to find new friends who could help us express ourselves to Dan.

### Requirements
- Flask (0.11.1 works fine for me)


### Usage
To run the website server, run ```python server.py```

Once the server is launched, visit your localhost (0.0.0.0:80) (your terminal should tell you where to go.) Ctrl+C to end it.


##### Note
We registered youredisappointing.me for this. As far as I know, it's not actually live. Sorry.
